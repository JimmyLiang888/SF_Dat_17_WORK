#GA Data Science Work

Hello!

As a data science professional, I aspire to be in a role that will allow me to apply my technical and analytical expertise to bring insights to complex problems through data analytics and implementation of analytic tools and processes.

I presented “Analyzing the Purchasing Power of Currencies” as my project deliverable for General Assembly Data Science. It can be found at the following GitHub link.

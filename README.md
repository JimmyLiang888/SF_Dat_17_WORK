**Currency Purchase Power**

I want to track the purchase power of different currencies to determine whether a given currency is gaining or losing value.

Currency: USD, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc

This topic interests me because I am curious about how we can leverage the purchase power of the currency to our advantage.

I presented “Analyzing the Purchasing Power of Currencies” as my project deliverable for General Assembly Data Science. It can be found at the following GitHub link.
